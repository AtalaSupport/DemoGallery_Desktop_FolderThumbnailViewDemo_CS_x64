# FolderThumbnailViewDemo (AKA FolderThumbs)

## About the Demo
This is a demo that shows how to use our FolderThumbnailView windows formc control

The original demo was named "FolderThumbs"

This is the C# version. We also offer a [VB.NET version](https://github.com/AtalaSupport/DemoGallery_Desktop_FolderThumbnailViewDemo_VB_x64).  


## About the FolderThumbnailView control
The FolderThumbnailView is a control (derived from the ThumbnailView class) that 
will display images in a directory as thumbnails, and monitor/update as it detects
changes .This is useful for displaying the contents of a directory on disk.  The 
demo shows how the thumbnails can be resized, reordered, and used to show a larger 
version of the image in the viewer. A background image may also be added to the 
thumbnails, along with many other features available in the thumbnail control.

This control is great for incorporating into your own custom Digital Asset 
Management (DAM) or similar application.

You can use it in combination with our other controls, for instance, use it 
to provide the top level thumbs for the documents in a directlry and wire it up
so that clicking on a given thumb opens the full doucment in our DocuemtnViewer 
or DocumentAnnotationViewer controls


## Licensing
This application requires a license for DotImage Document Imaging. If you wish to have PDF support, you can add our PdfReader addon licensing. You may also request a 30 day evaulation if youre evaluating if DotImage / our OCR is right for you.


## SDK Dependencies
This app was built based on 2026.2.0.0. It targets .NET Framework 4.6.2 and was created in Visual Studio 2022. You must have our SDK installed (and licesed per above)

### Using NuGet for SDK Dependencies
We do publish our SDK components to NuGet. We have chosen to base the demo on local installed SDK because this leads to much smaller applications (NuGet packages add a lot of overhead due to the way they're packaged and deployed, and many of our demos -- including this one -- are often used to reproduce issues that need to be submitted to support. Apps that use NuGet are often significantly larger and run up against our maximum support case upload size)

Still, if you wish to use NuGet for the dependencies instead of relying on locally installed SDK, you can.
